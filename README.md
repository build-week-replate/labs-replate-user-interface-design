# We're creating an app and user interface for Replate, and organization geared towards eliminating food waste by bridging the gap between businesses with left over food and non-profit organizations that help feed the hungry. 

#I've created my layout using the following frameworks: Bootstrap, Google Fonts, Font Awesome, and GSAP.
